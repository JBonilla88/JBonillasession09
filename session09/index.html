				<h2>The Celebration of Life and Death</h2>
				<section>
					<h3>What is it?</h3>
					<p>Day of the Dead, also known as Dia de Los Muertos, is a celebration that occurs on the 2nd of
						November in Mexico. This celebration is personal moment for every family to get together and
						celebrate the lives of those who have passed away. Through this celebration, many families
						decorate their homes and streets to welcome the dead back home. An altar is made to commemorate
						those they've lost and welcome them with food, drinks and snacks they loved when they were
						alive. Art is also a big cultural thing during the Day of the Dead. Many people dress up in
						traditional Mexican clothing and paint their faces to resemble that of a skull. However, they
						add an extra touch of color by making extravagant and vibrant color designs on their skull
						faces. This can also be seen in sugar skulls! These are small treats that are made to resemble a
						skull as well and they're decorated in vibrant colors too.</p>

					<h3>The Dates</h3>
					<p>
						Festivities often begin on the evening of 31 October and conclude on 2 November, but some rural
						communities in Mexico begin their observance as early as 27 October, when those deceased without
						families or friends can find sustenance for their souls in the form of crusts of bread and water
						vessels hung outside of homes. In these communities, even the unknown are not forgotten.
						<br><br>
						On the next day, celebrants accommodate the souls of those who died violent deaths, and who
						might be viewed as malevolent spirits:
						<br>
						30 and 31 October mark the days when communities commemorate and welcome back the souls of
						children, those who died before being baptized and after baptism, respectively. On 1 November,
						the souls of the adult dead are welcomed back by their families. These loved ones, sometimes
						known as the 'Faithful Dead', are welcomed back with ringing church bells and home ofrendas,
						where their family members await. During the days of the festival, families tend to the
						gravesites of their loved ones. Celebrants clean, repair, and decorate graves, bring and share
						food, light candles, and sometimes play or enjoy music in the cemeteries. The festivities
						conclude at dusk on 2 November, when the dead still lingering among the living make their way
						back to the afterlife, sometimes with the aid of masked 'mummers' tasked with frightening away
						the souls who might dawdle in the world of the living.
						<br><br>
						During each day of the celebration, as souls are welcomed, the living create ofrendas, where
						they display food, flowers, and visual art, often including scenes or iconography with skulls
						and skeletons, to help them connect with and provide sustenance for the souls of the dead.

					<h3>The Altar</h3>
					<p>An ofrenda, meaning "offering" in Spanish, is a unique and prominent part of the Day of the Dead
						celebrations. Assembled by all able members of the family, ofrendas are usually made on a table
						or platform, though some are tiered and resemble a step pyramid, and are traditionally covered
						with a decorative cloth. Once the surface is covered, family members begin carefully arranging
						the structure's namesakes, the offerings.<br><br>
						What is ultimately placed on an ofrenda depends entirely on the people assembling it and those
						deceased souls to whom the offerings are given, but most ofrendas include food, water, candles,
						and colorful tissue paper garlands known as papel picados. Other objects on an ofrenda might
						include flowers, photographs of the deceased, statues of saints, prayer cards, sweets, and other
						mementos of importance to the dead. The journey from the afterlife to the realm of the living is
						generally viewed as long and tiring, so some families include personal cleaning items such as
						soap, combs, razors, and toothbrushes on their ofrenda, so that the souls of the deceased can
						refresh themselves on their arrival. Moreover, ofrendas that commemorate the souls of children
						might include new toys, milk, or clothing, while the offerings arranged for the souls of adults
						might include favorite alcoholic beverages and other objects that reflect the preferences of the
						deceased in life. In addition to the objects placed on the offering tables, some ofrendas will
						have a woven mat laid in front to give the souls a place to rest when they arrive. In some
						cases, families construct an arch—decorated with flowers, hanging food items, or palm
						leaves—over their ofrenda.
						<br><br>
						Ofrendas might also include a cross among the assembled objects. These crosses might represent
						the pan-Mexican idea of the Tree of Life. According to these beliefs, the tree supports the sky
						and creates a sort of pathway connecting the three levels of the world: "the starry arch of
						heaven, the stony Middleworld of earth made to flower and bear fruit by the blood of kings, and
						the dark waters of the Underworld below" (Haley & Fukuda 2004, 135). With this in mind, the
						ofrenda table itself represents a microcosm of the world, with the tabletop representing the
						world of the living, where offerings are presented, the floor representing the underworld, where
						the dead can rest, and the arch representing the sky, which stretches over all else.

					<h3>The Flowers</h3>
					<p>
						Flowers are another of the many objects used as a decorative element in celebrations of the Day
						of the Dead. Symbolizing the brevity of life, flor de muertos lend their beauty and fragrance to
						the festivities, and a few types of flowers are particularly prevalent during this holiday. The
						most recognizable of these is the marigold. Marigold flowers were known to the Aztec
						civilization as cempoaxochitl, deriving from the Nahuatl words cemposalli, meaning "twenty," and
						xochitl, meaning "flower." Thus, the term roughly translates to "flower of twenty petals" or
						"twenty flower." Herrera-Sobek refers to it as "the flower of 400 lives" and mentions a Nahua
						belief that the marigold had been a gift from the sun god Tonatiuh for the purpose of honoring
						the dead. Brightly colored and fragrant, marigolds are traditionally believed to help lead the
						souls of the dead, who are said to have a keen sense of smell, to the offerings prepared for
						their arrival. Some communities scatter marigold petals to form a path within their homes
						between the front door and the ofrenda, or, in smaller villages, paths leading to the cemeteries
						to help the dead return to the afterlife following the festivities.
						<br><br>
						While marigolds are the most ubiquitously associated with the holiday, some orchid species in
						the genus Laelia, including L. autumnales, L. albida, and L. gouldiana are native to Mexico and
						have been used in Day of the Dead ceremonies for centuries. According to the Smithsonian Gardens
						Orchid Collection, this role has led to their cultivation by locals and the acquisition of names
						like "calaverite", lily of all saints, flower of the dead, and flower of the souls for specific
						Laelia species.

			<h2>Fun Facts</h2>
			<p>Día de los Muertos has emerged and evolved in Mexico over centuries and finds roots in an Aztec or Mexica
				ritual known as Miccaihuitl, which “was an honoring of the dead, but it was also the time for
				harvesting,” according to Mexican American studies scholar Michelle Téllez, per the University of
				Arizona news.
				<br><br>
				When the Spanish colonized the Aztec empire, they blended many indigenous rituals and beliefs with
				Catholicism and Christianity. This meant that the festival and rites of honoring the dead were moved
				from the late summer to November 1 and 2 to coincide with All Saints Day and All Souls Day, per the
				Smithsonian American Art Museum. But different parts of Mexico celebrate it starting anywhere from Oct.
				31 and going as late as Nov. 6, according to the BBC.
				<br><br>
				An ofrenda means “offering” in Spanish and is central to Día de los Muertos. Families set up these
				ofrendas—or altars—with photos of loved ones who have passed along with flowers, candles, and offerings
				to our ancestors like drinks and food they loved.
				<br><br>
				Día de los Muertos is infused with the belief that if we continue to remember and celebrate our departed
				loved ones, then, in a way, they will live on in our hearts as well as in our memories. By placing their
				photos on the altar and recounting memories, they are with us and in us. It also reminds us of the
				cycles of life, so we can celebrate the beauty in joy that exists in life alongside death.
				<br><br>
				Bright orange marigolds abound in Day of the Dead celebrations—and for a reason. According to NPR,
				historical accounts have found marigolds (cempasúchil in Spanish or cempohualxochitl or cempaxochitl in
				Nahuatl) have been used in traditional Mesoamerican rituals and feasts used to honor the dead because
				they’re believed to lead the souls of the dead to ofrendas. Marigolds continue to be used in Día de los
				Muertos celebrations for this reason, thanks to their vibrant color and distinct aroma (again, luring
				the spirits of deceased loved ones to the land of the living).
