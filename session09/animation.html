			<h2>Fun Facts</h2>
			<p>The ceramic figurines and images of La Catrina are ever-present around Day of the Dead and have a fascinating history. According to National Geographic, in the early 1900s, the artist and illustrator José Guadalupe Posada created Catrina as a satire ridiculing and commenting on Mexican high society’s taste for European fashions. And today, La Catrina continues on, symbolizing the inevitable aspect of death.  
				<br><br>
				Little skulls fashioned out of sugar paste are a beautiful and historic part of Day of the Dead. According to the Mexic-Arte Museum in Austin, Texas, the imagery of skulls dates back to pre-colonial times, while the art of sugar sculpting is something the Spanish brought with them. These gorgeous, mini pieces of art can have loved ones’ names on them and can be placed on the ofrenda in remembrance.
				<br><br>
				For Día de los Muertos, bakeries are filled with pan de muerto, sweet bread fashioned into many shapes and sizes like little figurines or loaves decorated with bones (huesos) to represent this honoring of our dead.
				<br><br>
				As part of Day of the Dead, many families visit their loved ones in cemeteries, bringing food and cleaning the grave area. In Los Angeles, the famous Hollywood Forever Cemetery (the resting place of actress Judy Garland, actor Rudolph Valentino and the musician Chris Cornell, to name a few) features a historic Day of the Dead celebration featuring “gorgeous altars, Mexica (Aztec) dancers, five stages of music and dance, arts and crafts, a ritual procession and much more, attracting attendees from around the world.”
				<br><br>
				According to the Grace Museum, the Monarch butterflies complete their long journey to Mexico around Day of the Dead, so have come to represent the spirit of the loved ones who have departed.
